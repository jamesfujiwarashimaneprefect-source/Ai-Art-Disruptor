Ai-Art-Disruptor
-A tool designed to protect artists' work from unauthorized AI training by adding imperceptible perturbations to images that disrupt machine learning models while keeping the artwork visually unchanged to human eyes.

Overview
AI Art Disruptor helps artists protect their creative work from being scraped and used to train AI models without consent. The tool applies adversarial noise patterns that are invisible to humans but cause AI models to misinterpret or fail to learn from the images effectively.
